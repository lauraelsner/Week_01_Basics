#FEWD Week #1: HTML/CSS Basics


---


###Description


For the first assignment, you will begin creating the beginnings of your first website. Take what you've learned from class and build a portfolio site that showcases all of the projects you'll be completing over the next few weeks. Build two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio' - that link to one another. Your 'About Page' should describe your mission and value proposition and your 'Portfolio' should include [screenshots](starter_code/images) with descriptions of the work you [will] do for Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and CitiPix. Don't worry if you can't come up with any text for the pages--we've provided you with [some sample copy](starter_code/sample_copy.txt) that you can use.

###Real-World Applications


- Create a website with multiple pages that link together
- Style a page using CSS via an external stylesheet
- Add images to a website to improve SEO
- Clearly articulate your skills and experience on a landing page
- Provide customers or site visitors with important contact and social media information in a format they're accustomed to

###Technical Requirements

- Link both pages together using `a` tag
- Use a unique `title` and a single unique `h1` tag
- Show images using `img` tags including unique `alt` attributes
- Use an external CSS stylesheet to style your pages
- Select at least 5 elements on the page and apply at least 5 different css properties (`font-size`, `color`, `font-family`, `background`, `text-decoration`) to these elements
- Use at least 6 different HTML tags (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `a`, `img`) on your pages
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across your .html and .css files
- Indent nested elements to increase your code's readability

#### Bonus

- Google “css class attribute” in order to style the avatar image specifically to `float: right;`
- Experiment by adding additional HTML tags and CSS properties we did not cover in class - explore!
